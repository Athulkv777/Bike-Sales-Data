The analysis of the data indicates that the majority of bike sales occur within lower to middle-income ie,50,000 to 60,000 range has the highest sales. A notable decline in sales is observed in the 30,000 to 40,000 and 70,000 to 80,000 ranges, indicating that middle-income consumers are less consistent in their bike purchasing habits. Minimal sales happened in very high income group, with just over 20 bikes sold. According to the chart, females have purchased slightly fewer bikes than males, with the female count being just under 500, and the male count slightly exceeding 500.
The bar representing homeowners indicates a significantly higher count of bike purchases, extending close to the 700 mark. Around 310-320 bikes were purchased by individuals who do not own homes. Homeowners have purchased more than twice the number of bikes compared to non-homeowners. The data indicates a strong correlation between homeownership and bike purchases, with homeowners purchasing a considerably higher number of bikes.
Individuals with a larger number of children demonstrate a significantly lower interest in purchasing bikes compared to those with one or two children. Similarly, car owners exhibit markedly diminished interest in acquiring bikes.
Based on the regional distribution of bike purchases across three regions: Europe, North America, and the Pacific. North America accounts for the largest share with 51% of purchases, indicating that over half of all bike sales are concentrated in this region. Europe follows with 30%, representing nearly a third of the total purchases. The Pacific region has the smallest share at 19%, contributing less than one-fifth of the bike purchases. This data suggests significant regional differences in bike purchasing patterns, with North America being the dominant market.
